#Write a program prime number ?
'''1)My Own program  Instraction in 
If n is less than or equal to 1, it's not a prime number, so the function returns False.
If n is 2 or 3, it's a prime number, so the function returns True.
If n is divisible by 2 or 3, it's not a prime number, so the function returns False.
It checks divisibility for numbers of the form 6k Â± 1 up to the square root of n. 
This optimization helps reduce the number 
of divisions needed to determine primality.
Finally, the program prompts the user to enter a number, checks if it's prime using 
the is_prime function, and prints the result.'''

    n=int(input("enter the number:"))
